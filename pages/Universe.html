<h1>The Universe</h1>
<p>The word "Universe" derives from the Latin term "universum." The Latin word was used by Cicero and later by other authors with the same meaning it has today. The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction "unvorsum," first used by Lucretius in Book IV of his work "On the Nature of Things," which combines "un," "uni" (meaning "one") with "vorsum," "versum" (which means "something turned, rolled, or changed").
